Welcome to the **Flemming Project**, a data-driven journey to predict bacterial resistance patterns and recommend optimized antibiotic treatments using machine learning.

This project is designed as both a **functional system and an educational portfolio**, where you can follow each stage step by step.

## 🚀 Project Notebooks Overview

### 1. 🌐 Hacking the Matrix: Automated API Data Collection for Microbial Resistance (APIDataCollection)
Automates the collection of bacterial sample metadata and AST results from NCBI APIs.

### 2. 📂 The Local Data Goldmine: Mining Resistance Genes in Our Backyard (LocalDataCollection)
Extracts and cleans locally stored resistance gene data.

### 3. 🔬 Into the Petri Dish: Exploratory Data Analysis (FlemmingML_EDA) 
Explores the cleaned and merged dataset, revealing patterns, gaps, and surprises in bacterial resistance profiles.

### 4. 🤖 FlemmingML_PyTorch: Building Our Neural Network Prototype
Prototypes a PyTorch model that predicts antibiotic resistance based on partial antibiogram data, resistance markers, and organism groups.

### 5. 🧪 Robustness and Bias Testing (Planned)
Challenges the model with OOD samples, adversarial cases, and assesses potential biases.

### 6. 💡 Inference Pipeline & Recommendations (Planned)
Integrates the model into a user-friendly inference pipeline to provide optimized antibiotic recommendations.

## 🎯 Next Steps
- Implement **robustness testing pipelines**.
- Refine the **inference and recommendation engine**.
- Validate and prepare the system for clinical-style decision support scenarios.

Stay tuned for the next steps in the **Flemming saga**. 🚀
